                    <p class = "text-left">Mealsharing is one of the newer innovations of the sharing economy. It allows home-based chefs the opportunity to run a business from their own kitchen, on their own terms. As an industry, it is developing on several distinct paths. 1. Destination Dining. Championed by <a href="https://www.vizeat.com" target ="_blank">Vizeat</a>, diners book immersive experiences outside of their home area. More often than not, experiences are booked in a foreign country. 2. Event Dining. Championed by <a href ="https://eatfeastly.com/" target = "_blank">Feastly</a>, diners book events either in a chef's home or in a space managed by the company. A third branch has begun to take hold; targeting the every-day consumer, take-out meal sharing lets consumers purchase innovatative take-out directly from skilled chefs in their own area. <a href="https://www.josephine.com/" target = "_blank">Josephine</a> is making in-roads in this market on the West Coast.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The sharing economy is still emerging. “The sharing economy is estimated to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025. <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>” The digital technology that created platforms to get a cheaper ride or a place to stay is ready to be adopted by other segments of the economy. In 2016, 52% of Americans ordered take-out from several times a month or more <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>.  A robust meal-sharing application is the ideal platform to bring busy consumers a variety of cuisines prepared by home-based chefs. This is the market segment that YummEats will fill.</p>
