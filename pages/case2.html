              <h2>The Design Problem: Be the first to bring a global food trend to Waikiki</h2>
              <p>I was asked to develop the opening website for the first Bubble Waffle shop located in Waikiki, Hawaii. Being the first bubble waffle shop in the area creates a unique challenge to be visible to tourists who know the product, and to educate the local market to the product. </p>
              <h4>Case Background</h4>
              <p class="last">Hong Kong-style waffles matched with locally made and inspired ice cream topped with multiple treats are the perfect snack and dessert option for Waikiki. Bubble waffles are the hottest trend in the UK and Australia,  and are beginning to appear in US markets. </p>
              <p>There are over 7.7 million tourists a year. Every day 100,000 plus tourists are looking for options that are convenient, affordable, and delicious.</p>

          <div class="method-text">
            <p>After completing this research, I decided to develop a design that highlights realistic photography
              of the bubble waffle product to help educate the market. For typography, I wanted to develop a wordmark that would be friendly but not juvenile or kitschy. The color palette would need to appeal to the Asian market. Programming elements include smooth scrolling and Google Map API integration.

        <h5>Fonts</h5>
        <p>Helvetica Neue was selected as a the primary text font for readability and familiarty. </p>
        <p>Bariol was selected for the logo for its mix of a professional yet friendly feel.</p>
        <img class ="element big-element" src="../images/fonts.png">
    </div>
    <div class="item">
       <h5>Photography</h5>
       <p>A conscious effort was made to  portray  the   YummEats customer, as well as portraying a chef in   a profile, in order to   build human connections and community.
          In addition,  quality food photography is featured. </p>

        <h5>Branding</h5>
        <p>Red was selected  logo  color for its association with food and emotion.</p>

            <h5>Buttons</h5>
            <p>The initial button color for food options, black, was judged too harsh next to the food. A more harmonius color with adequate contrast was selected.</p>

            <h5>UX</h5>
            <p>An early attempt to portray more information about a chef’s menu before entering the order workflow was rejected as creating unnecessary clicks. The flow was revised to speed up ordering.</p>

    <div id="lessons-learned">

      <p>This project highlighted the importance of having an inventory of digital assets before beginning the design work. Since the Bubble Waffle isn’t well known, there is inadequate free quality photography available from traditional sources. Adobe Stock images were utilized, however, the original intended layouts had to be modified since there are almost no appropriate images in portrait mode.</p>

      <p>My scrolling script also interfered with my mobile navigation script, which necessitated smaller design changes to finish the project on time. </p>

      <p>My stakeholder for this project, which is a real business that is being launched, is six time-zones behind me. This occasionally caused communication delays, and highlights the importance of developing a schedule of deliverables for clients. </p
