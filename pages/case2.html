        <h2>The Design Problem:</h2>
        <h3>Be the first to bring a global food trend to Waikiki</h3>
        <p>I was asked to develop a responsive website  for the first bubble waffle shop in Waikiki, Hawaii.  It’s vital that the site appeal to the Instagram-crazy Asian tourist market, who already know what a bubble waffles are, as well as locals, who aren’t familiar with the product. </p>
        <h4>Case Background</h4>
        <p>Hong Kong-style waffles matched with locally made and inspired ice cream topped with multiple treats are the perfect snack and dessert option for Waikiki. Bubble waffles are the hottest trend in the UK and Australia,  and are beginning to appear in US markets. Being the first bubble waffle shop in the are creates a unique challenge to be visible to tourists who know the product, and to educate the local market to the product.</p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="methodology">

        <h3 class="bold">User research was developed to learn the following:</h3>
         <div class="method-detail">
          <ul class="list">
            <li>The frequency of take-out purchases </li>
  	 	      <li>How consumers choose where they get there take-out food</li>
          	<li>Comfort level with mobile technology</li>
          	<li>Prior knowledge of mealsharing</li>
          	<li>Willingness to utilize a new platform</li>
          	<li>Perceived obstacles to acceptance and use</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="method-text">
            <p>After completing this research, personas were developed to drive empathetic design and understanding of the typical potential user’s needs.</p>
            <p>Competivite analysis was undertaken to understand the approach and focus of business that represent early entries to the market.</p>
            <p>The design and branding was then developed and tested based on these inputs.</p>

   <h3>Design Decisions</h3>

   <div class="design">
    <div class="design-element">
        <h5>Fonts</h5>
        <p>Helvetica Neue was selected as a the primary text font for readability and familiarty. </p>
        <p>Bariol was selected for the logo for its mix of a professional yet friendly feel.</p>
        <img class ="element" src="../images/fonts.png">
    </div>
     <div class="design-element">
        <h5>Branding</h5>
        <p>Red was choosen as the main  logo  color for its traditional associations with food and emotion.</p>
        <img src="../images/icon.png">
     </div>
     <div class="design-element">
        <h5>Photography</h5>
        <p>A conscious effort was made to  portray  the   YummEats customer, as well as portraying a chef in   a profile, in order to   build human connections and community.
           In addition,  quality food photography is featured. </p>

     <h3>User Testing</h3>

          <div class="item">
            <h5>CTA</h5>
            <p>The initial button color for food options, black, was judged too harsh next to the food. A more harmonius color with adequate contrast was selected.</p>

          <div class="item">
            <h5>Logo Development</h5>
            <p>A/B testing was used to identify improvements to the logo; as a result, an attempt to portray a hot bowl of food with steam was rejected for a cleaner approach.</p>

            <h5>UX</h5>
            <p>An early attempt to portray more information about a chef’s menu before entering the order workflow was rejected as creating unnecessary clicks. The flow was revised to speed up ordering.</p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="lessons-learned">

      <p>This project highlighted the difference between UI and UX. I designed screens that looked good-but a customer would abandon because I was asking them to take too many steps to complete a task. This has encouraged me to think about user-flows more deeply. </p>
      <p>Additionally, this project gave me the opportunity to appreciate the importance of researching throughout the project life-cycle. A/B testing and prototype testing was utilized to create a better design. </p>
      <p>I identified working with 8-pixel grids as a consideration for future projects to improve the vertical rhythm in my designs.</p>
