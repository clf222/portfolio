              <h2>The Design Problem: </h2><h2>Be the first to bring a global food trend to Waikiki</h2>
              <p>I was asked to develop the opening website for the first Bubble Waffle shop located in Waikiki, Hawaii. Being the first bubble waffle shop in the area creates a unique challenge to be visible to tourists who know the product, and to educate the local market to the product. </p>
              <h4>Roles:</h4>
              <p>Research, Branding, Design, UI, Development (HTML, CSS, JS)</p>
              <h4>Case Background</h4>
              <p class="last">Hong Kong-style waffles matched with locally made and inspired ice cream topped with multiple treats are the perfect snack and dessert option for Waikiki. Bubble waffles are the hottest trend in the UK and Australia,  and are beginning to appear in US markets. </p>
              <p>There are over 7.7 million tourists a year. Every day 100,000 plus tourists are looking for options that are convenient, affordable, and delicious.</p>

           <h4>User research was developed to learn the following:</h4>

              <li>The frequency of snack and beverage purchases</li>
    	 	      <li>How consumers choose where to buy snacks and beverages</li>
            	<li>Use of mobile vs. desktop browsing</li>
            	<li>Importance of social platforms such as Instagram</li>

          <div class="text">
            <p>After completing this research, I decided to develop a design that highlights realistic photography
              of the bubble waffle product to help educate the market. </p>
            <p>For typography, I wanted to develop a wordmark that would be friendly but not juvenile or kitschy. </p>
            <p>The color palette would need to appeal to the Asian market. </p>
            <p>Programming elements would include smooth scrolling and Google Map API integration to improve the user-experience and keep users within the website while on their phones.</p>

     <div class="summary summary-right">
        <h4 class="transform">Fonts</h4>
        <p>Baloo, a font-family with Asian roots, was chosen for the wordmark for its playful and friendly appearance. Its rounded terminals are reminiscent of Hello Kitty, the popular Asian character.</p>
        <p>Hind was chosen for the body of the site. It's a sans-serif font that was developed for user interface design. Most strokes have straight endings, which provides needed balance to Baloo's rounded features. The two fonts share similar x-heights as well.</p>
        <h2 class="baloo">Baloo</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="summary">
        <h4 class="transform">Development</h4>
        <p> Flexbox CSS was utilized in order to take advantage of modern browser support  for improved responsive layouts. It is designed to accommodate additional content while maintaining appropriate spacing across various screen widths and heights.</p>
        <p><a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/" target="_blank" class="link"> Fullpage.js </a>was utilized to create smooth scrolling that works both on mobile touch screens and desktops.  </p>

    </div>
     <div class="summary summary-right">
        <h4 class="transform">Branding</h4>
        <p>It is critical that the site's imagery resonate with the Asian Market. Rose Pink is uniformly associated with feminine characteristics in Asian countries. Although shades of black are uniformly viewed as masculine, it was rejected for Cerulean Blue, which also is viewed as masculine in Asia, <sup ><a class="alt" href="https://www.intage.co.jp/english/asia_insight/20130911.html#.WfXr8hOPJE5" target="_blank">1</a></sup> and is universally recognized as symbolizing trust. Pairing the two colors presents a brand that is fun, trustworthy, and for both men and women. </p>

            <h4>Logo and Imagery</h4>
            <p>Initial logo tests were rejected as being too unrealistic, which would only confuse potential customers. A simple wordmark that would appeal to the emotions of the target demographics was developed instead. </p>

            <h4>Navigation</h4>
            <p>The initial nav bar was confusing to users at mobile widths. Since research indicated the site's users are very sophisticated consumers of mobile content, I opted to remove it on the mobile site and add hinting to the home page to indicate the scrolling capabilities.</p>
            <img class="element big-element" alt="screenshot of home page" src="../images/nav.jpg">

            <p>Multiple fonts, including one chosen by the client, were examined for appropriateness  and legibility. To make the final selection, multiple A/B tests were run to ultimately select the final font for the wordmark.</p>

             <p>Since the Bubble Waffle isn't well-known, it was given prime placement on the site. Visitors need to want a Bubble Waffle before they need to know where they are located. Location-finding icons are standardized enought that one-click access to location information is sufficient. </p>
             <p>The Instagram feed was moved higher on the page to reflect it's importance to prospective user-base.</p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

    <div id="lessons-learned" class="blue-g">
      <div class="method-text">
        <p>This project highlighted the importance of having an inventory of digital assets before beginning the design work. Since the Bubble Waffle isn’t well known, there is inadequate free quality photography available from traditional sources. Adobe Stock images were utilized, however, the original intended layouts had to be modified since there are almost no appropriate images in portrait mode.</p>

        <p>My scrolling script also interfered with my mobile navigation script, which necessitated smaller design changes to finish the project on time. </p>

        <p>My stakeholder for this project, which is a real business that is being launched, is six time-zones behind me. This occasionally caused communication delays, and highlights the importance of developing a schedule of deliverables for clients. </p>
