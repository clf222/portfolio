              <p>I was asked to develop the design for and iOS application that would not just look good, but be usable, engender trust, and promote the growth of a virtually unknown business model for takeout food.</p>
              <h4>Roles:</h4>
              <p>Research, Branding, Design, Copy, UI, Prototyping</p>
              <h4>Case Background</h4>
              <p>The sharing economy is estimated to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025.”<sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharingeconomy_032017final.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The digital technology that created platforms to get a cheaper ride or a place to stay is ready to be adopted by other segments of the economy. In 2016, 52% of Americans ordered take-out from several times a month or more.<sup><a href=" https://www.statista.com/statistics/319662/frequency-of-ordering-food-for-takeout-or-delivery-us/" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>
              <p class="last">A robust meal-sharing application is the ideal platform to bring busy consumers a variety of cuisines prepared by home-based chefs.</p>

    <p>Our design will need to accomodate a tech-friendly user that is extremely comfortable completing purchases from their mobile device.</p>

        <p>This project highlighted the difference between UI and UX. I designed screens that looked good-but a customer would abandon because I was asking them to take too many steps to complete a task. This has encouraged me to think about user-flows more deeply. </p>
        <p>Additionally, this project gave me the opportunity to appreciate the importance of researching throughout the project life-cycle. A/B testing and prototype testing was utilized to create a better design. </p>
        <p>I identified working with 8-pixel grids as a consideration for future projects to improve the vertical rhythm in my designs.</p>
