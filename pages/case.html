          <h2>The Design Problem:</h2>
          <h3>Bring the Sharing Economy of Airbnb and Uber to Takeout</h3>
          <p>I was asked to develop the design for and iOS application that would not just look good, but be usable, engender trust, and promote the growth of a virtually unknown business model for takeout food.</p>
          <button name="prototype"><a href="https://invis.io/27CUO1KZ8" target="_blank">View the Prototype</a></button>
          <h4>Case Background</h4>
          <p>The sharing economy is estimated to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025.”<sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharingeconomy_032017final.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The digital technology that created platforms to get a cheaper ride or a place to stay is ready to be adopted by other segments of the economy. In 2016, 52% of Americans ordered take-out from several times a month or more.<sup><a href=" https://www.statista.com/statistics/319662/frequency-of-ordering-food-for-takeout-or-delivery-us/" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>
    <p class="last">A robust meal-sharing application is the ideal platform to bring busy consumers a variety of cuisines prepared by home-based chefs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="methodology">

          <h4>Methodology</h4>
          <p>User research was developed to learn the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The frequency of take-out purchases </li>
  	 	      <li>How consumers choose where they get there take-out food</li>
          	<li>Comfort level with mobile technology</li>
          	<li>Prior knowledge of mealsharing</li>
          	<li>Willingness to utilize a new platform</li>
          	<li>Perceived obstacles to acceptance and use</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After completing this research, personas were developed to drive empathetic design and understanding of the typical potential user’s needs.</p>
          <p>Competivite analysis was undertaken to understand the approach and focus of business that represent early entries to the market.</p>
          <p>The design and branding was then developed and tested based on these inputs.</p>

          <div class="case">
        <h5>Fonts</h5>

        <p>Helvetica Neue was selected as a the primary text font for readability and familiarty. </p>
        <p>Bariol was selected for the logo for its mix of a professional yet friendly feel.</p>

     <div class="case">
        <h5>Branding</h5>
        <p>Red was choosen as the main  logo  color for its traditional associations with food and emotion.</p>

     <div class="case">
        <h5>Photography</h5>
        <p>A conscious effort was made to  portray  the   YummEats customer, as well as portraying a chef in   a profile, in order to   build human connections and community.
In addition,  quality food photography is featured. </p>

        <h4>User Testing</h4>

          <div class="item">
            <p>The initial button color for food options, black, was judged too harsh next to the food. A more harmonius color with adequate contrast was selected.</p>

          </div>
          <hr class="style">
          <div class ="item">
            <p>A/B testing was used to identify improvements to the logo; as a result, an attempt to portray a hot bowl of food with steam was rejected for a cleaner approach.</p>

          <div class ="item">
            <p>An early attempt to portray more information about a chef’s menu before entering the order workflow was rejected as creating unnecessary clicks. The flow was revised to speed up ordering.</p>

    <div class="lessons-learned">
      <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
      <p>This project highlighted the difference between UI and UX. I designed screens that looked good-but a customer would abandon because I was asking them to take too many steps to complete a task. That is an important lesson. </p>
      <p>Additionally, this project gave me the opportunity to think about prototyping and testing in a different way. It was important to spend time interacting with other restaurant sites on my phone and think about user flows in greater detail. </p>
      <p>For a future learning goal, I identified working with vertical scale in my typography so that I could develop better rhythm in developing a design system.</p>
