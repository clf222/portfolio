        <h2>The Design Problem:</h2>
        <h3>Bring the Sharing Economy of Airbnb and Uber to Takeout</h3>
        <p>I was asked to develop the design for and iOS application that would not just look good, but be usable, engender trust, and promote the growth of a virtually unknown business model for takeout food.</p>

      <h4>Case Background</h4>
      <p>The sharing economy is estimated to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025.”<sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sharingeconomy_032017final.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The digital technology that created platforms to get a cheaper ride or a place to stay is ready to be adopted by other segments of the economy. In 2016, 52% of Americans ordered take-out from several times a month or more.<sup><a href=" https://www.statista.com/statistics/319662/frequency-of-ordering-food-for-takeout-or-delivery-us/" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>A robust meal-sharing application is the ideal platform to bring busy consumers a variety of cuisines prepared by home-based chefs.</p>

          <h4>Methodology</h4>
          <p>User research was developed to learn the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The frequency of take-out purchases </li>
  	 	      <li>How consumers choose where they get there take-out food</li>
          	<li>Comfort level with mobile technology</li>
          	<li>Prior knowledge of mealsharing</li>
          	<li>Willingness to utilize a new platform</li>
          	<li>Perceived obstacles to acceptance and use</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After completing this research, personas were developed to drive empathetic design and understanding of the typical potential user’s needs.</p>
          <p>Competivite analysis was undertaken to understand the approach and focus of business that represent early entries to the market.</p>
          <p>The design and branding was then developed and tested based on these inputs.</p>
